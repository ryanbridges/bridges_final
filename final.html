			<h2 class="title">Sports Gambling and It's Effects on the Sports World</h2>
			<h4> When sports gambling became legalized by the supreme court back in 2018, many people thought that the outcome of games would be the problem. However, what not many people envisioned was how much money these sports books would end up making year-in and year-out. Sports gambling ads have taken over the television sets of all sports fans across the U.S. Companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel have poured billions of dollars into advertising their products with special deals and promotions. I pulled data from Sports Handle to figure out if states have been able to keep up with taxing sports books and where certain trends are heading.

			<h3>How Much It's Grown</h3>
			<p>First off, you have to look at how much the industry has grown over the past few years. According to Forbes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/nyregion/sports-betting-ny.html">Americans wagered more than $57 billion on sports in 2021, a record, according to the American Gaming Association, even as casinos and other gambling outlets — which had been battered by pandemic lockdowns — rebounded with their highest-grossing year ever</a> (McKinley 1). This record was also shattered in 2022, as it only took 11 months to break the 2021 mark. 
			</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Legalization</h3>
			<p>The flood gates first opened back in 2018 when the Supreme Court overturned PAPSA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), which gave each of the 50 states the freedom to decide if they wanted to allow sports gambling. In May of 2018, Nevada was the first state. Georgia, North Carolina, and Minnesota are supposed to be the newest states to join in. </p>

			<h3>What's Being Done to Stop It</h3>
			<p>New York Congressman Paul Tonko intorduced legslation shortly after the Super Bowl in Feburary to ban sports betting advertisements. Tonko highlighted that the ads promise 'risk free' and 'no sweat' bets to get customers hooked on their products.</p>

			<h3>Primary Source</h3>
			<p>While many have pointed out the dangers that sports gambling presents for the integrity of sports and the economy, there are many people who have made a career out of sports gambling. One of those people is Evan Weinburg, a retention marketing strategist at Cesear's Sportsbook. Evan oversees all the work the company is doing with push notifications. He says the company sends emails out to all of their customers as well to keep them engaged. Weinburg also says the company can see who fans are betting on and what players, teams or sports they are interested in. Cesear's then sends notifications for what that specific fans likes. We've seen similar tactics be deployed for social media companies as well. 
			</p>
			<p>When I asked him about sports gambling ads on television, he pointed out that it started way before PASPA was overturned. Weinburg says, "Since the mid-2010s, Draft Kings and Fan Duel were buying lots of ad time for their daily fantasy platforms." Throughout our conversation, he made sure to mention that sports gambling did not just appear out of thin air in 2018. This was an industry that was ready to take off.</p>
			<p>I wanted to also get his take on if sports gambling has gotten out of hand. Weinburg notes, "We've almost had no match-fixing scandals in the United States since PAPSA was overturned... I can't see this impacting the integrity of the game."</p>

			<h3>It's Not Because People Aren't Betting The Right Way</h3>
			<p>This chart shows the Gross Gaming Revenue Win Rate, which is the percentage of money that the casino earns as profit compared to what is wagered. For example, in September of 2018, the sportsbooks made 11.71% more money then the amount that was bet. </p>
			<p>This chart proves that no matter if betters happen to win more money one month than they do another, the sportsbook will always win. There is also a stong positive correlation between the amount of money bet and the profit the casinos and sportbooks make.

		<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
		<p>There is no limit to how big sports gambling can become, and that can be worrysome. It was just last week that five NFL players got suspended for gambling on games last season. While the NFL has come down hard on these indivduals with suspensions. It's hard to say this won't continue with the growth of the game. Especially, with how easy it is to access betting through advertisements and social media. </p>
